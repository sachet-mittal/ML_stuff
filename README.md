Machine learning Things That I learn


Project-01:
==========

Learn Toxic Texts using LSTM:
-----------------------------

A better implementation of the code in: https://github.com/aldkak/toxic_text_classification

Reference Research: AIP Conference Proceedings 2048, 060011 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5082126

This is not the appraoch the authors published. This is the LSTM version of the problem solution.

Project-02:
==========

Connect Four Game:
-----------------

A simple connect 4 game. 
I didn't write most of the code. It is a part of class assigment
I wrote the code of how the AI player decides it's next move against a smart oppenent(another ai or human) or a random player

Project-03:
==========

Simulations
-----------

This is not actually a ML code.
This code generates simulations for an experiment.
The experiment is pretty difficult to explain so I am leaving that for now.
